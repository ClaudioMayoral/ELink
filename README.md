# Elink: Entrepreneurship Link App

Project emerged in response to the need for a platform (social network) where individuals can advertise their entrepreneurial projects and connect with partners and investors.

During our time at the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, we were equipped with ample tools and knowledge to encourage entrepreneurship. However, the aspect of networking with like-minded individuals who share similar interests and passions to aid in the creation and development of entrepreneurial projects was often overlooked. This led us to create a tool to facilitate this crucial but often neglected aspect.Furthermore, the objective of this project is to develop a mobile application using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology. The application aims to empower the entrepreneurial community by facilitating the dissemination, funding, and exploration of social and environmental projects.

The application allows our users to select between two types of profiles:

1. Sharky's
   
   These users are allowed to:
   
      - Execute transactions for approved project funds.
      - Keep abreast of new publications and investment opportunities.
      - Stay updated with the most relevant information on entrepreneurship and supported projects.
      - Maintain contact through instant messaging with diverse profiles.
      - Engage with other entrepreneurs and investors.
      - Be ranked by reliability level according to the karma system.

3. Sheepy's
   
   These users are allowed to:
   
      - Secure financing reliably and confidently.
      - Stay updated with the most relevant information on entrepreneurship topics.
      - Engage with other entrepreneurs and investors.
      - Have the exclusive ability to create projects.
      - Publish projects and adding information to categorize them effectively.
      - Utilize instant messaging with profiles of all types.
      - View general information of profiles such as investors and observing their ratings.
      - Be classified by level of reliability according to the karma system.
      - Receive transactions from funds received by your projects.
